<p><span class="smcap">Coasting</span> along the arid Syrian shore, there is
little to attract the attention of the traveller from
Port Said to Jaffa, till the last-named town is in
sight. If, however, there is a haze upon the
water and the wind is from the shore, a powerful
perfume of orange-flowers borne across the sea is
the first intimation that one is nearing Jaffa,
perhaps the most ancient town—certainly one of
the most ancient towns—in the world. Presuming
that no wind has sprung up since you left the
Egyptian port—in which case you will be carried
on to Beyrout, as the steamers only touch at Jaffa
in calm weather, owing to the danger and almost
impossibility of landing passengers or goods—presuming,
however, that all is well, you reach
Jaffa most probably in the early morning; and
having anchored outside a reef of rocks which
incloses a natural harbour permitting the entrance
only of small boats, you look upon a scene as
picturesque and peculiarly eastern in its character
as you could wish. Rising abruptly from the
sea, the whitened, flat-roofed houses intermingle
with the domes of the mosques and the convent
towers; while the surmounting citadel, the surrounding
wall, and massive gates, give the distinctive
character that one had observed in
Tangier, or Algiers, or Cairo.</p>

<p>Along the quay is collected a throng of
people, containing representatives of half the
ports in the Levant or the East. Huge brown-sailed
boats are moored in the smooth water
within; while outside, the water washes over
the encircling rocks—the fabled rocks of Andromeda’s
captivity. Palms and plantain trees are
scattered here and there, with the glimpse of
orchards beyond; and stately camels, with their
stalwart Bedouin guides, carrying bales of merchandise
or corn, now and again move across
the line of vision on the shore. And now the
boats are putting out to the steamer, and the
swarthy boatmen ply their oars with vigour; and
boats filled with oranges and lemons and gigantic
melons, and bright-hued fishes, swarm around us.
Not least, to add to the general effect, and certainly
chiefest for one’s individual comfort, are the men
of Cook and Howard the agents, clad respectively
in blue and red, who in well-manned boats are at
the service of the traveller. Here, be it remarked,
that whatever prejudice may exist amongst ordinary
British travellers against ‘Cooking it’ on
the continent, in the East the services of these
agents are invaluable; and the travelling public
owes much to them for having brought dragomans,
guides, hotel-keepers, and stable-keepers to some
decency in the matter of their charges. Placing
ourselves in the hands of one of them, we are
landed at the quay, and pass along the narrow
crowded street that leads to the market-place at
the top of the town.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck one was the remarkable
beauty of the inhabitants, men and women
alike. Jews, Turks, Syrians, and Arabs were all
in marked contrast to the ugly squat Egyptians
amongst whom we had recently sojourned; and
the Bedouins are a much finer race than those of
either the Egyptian or Sinaitic Desert, whose
acquaintance we had just made. As may be
assumed, there is a marked Jewish cast of countenance—as
we call it at home—amongst all classes,
even to the Bedouins. The camels, too, are larger
and finer looking. It is to be feared, however,
that it is only in physical qualities that the
Syrians can show a superiority to the Egyptians;
morally, they appear to be very much on
a par.</p>

<p>We pass along the winding antiquated street,
through ancient arches, up occasional broad steps,
past shops of all kinds—holes in the wall, where
Jews and Greeks, squatted on their hams, are
ready to sell you anything from an estate to a
pair of slippers—jostled by camels and mules
and donkeys carrying grain and merchandise
of various kinds, and accompanied by the handsome
picturesque Bedouins of the Syrian Desert,
through bazaars with fruit-sellers, water-carriers,
and hawkers of all kinds plying their various
trades, until we reach the market-place, where
there seems to be more spirit and business-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">{322}</span>
animation than one usually sees in the East. The
house of Simon the tanner is pointed out to us,
and we receive the information with the necessary
reserve. But there are unmistakable tanneries
in its neighbourhood, if that evidence goes for
anything. Arrived at the hotel, we first ordered
a couple of horses to be got ready as soon as possible;
and having viewed the sorry-looking hacks,
took a hurried breakfast, as we were anxious to
be on the road. Good horses and saddles are
usually to be obtained in Syria without any
difficulty, but we had unfortunately hit upon the
very time when they were least plentiful, namely,
the Thursday following Easter Sunday. Breakfast
was not a very long affair, consisting of the
inevitable cutlet and eggs, anchovies, sliced sausages,
olives, figs, and oranges—to which some
months in the East had made us familiar. A
most dirty and exasperating waiter, who seemed
to take more than the average delight of his
Syrian countrymen in telling lies, boldly asked
for ‘backsheesh,’ informing us that his former
statement as to being the proprietor was untrue;
and when he saw us loading our revolvers, asked
what we were ‘going to shoot his people for;
that was not good!’ However, he did us the
honour to guide us personally to a point where
the road led to Jerusalem; and away we went on
our journey.</p>

<p>The road was very dusty, but the air was full
of the perfume of flowers; and it was delicious
to ride past the orange groves and gardens and
orchards that extended for nearly a mile out of
the busy, jostling, evil-smelling town. After passing
the orchards and gardens, the road becomes
rather tame and barren, and though well enough
for riding, must be terribly disagreeable for those
who undertake the journey by carriage. We
met many pilgrims returning from Jerusalem—there
had been ten thousand of them there in
Holy Week. They came trooping past, on camels,
mules, donkeys, and horses, in carts and carriages,
and many on foot. They were chiefly
Russians, but many were Levantines. Many
carried the precious relics that had been made
sacred to them by being laid upon the Holy
Sepulchre, or perhaps thrust into the so-called
‘Holy Fire.’ Sometimes a crowd would appear
in the distance, and the long cylindrical tins containing
sanctified candles—some of them five or
six feet long—would shine like lances in the sun.
‘Family’ camels with a sort of howdah, or a
canopy with beds on either side or ‘atop,’ would
hold some three or four children and their mother.
Others would be squatted on the top of their
baggage. All their faces had a pleased and satisfied
look, as of having accomplished a desirable
work. At intervals of a mile or so, we passed
the guardhouses of the police, placed for the
protection of the road to Jerusalem; and after
about three hours and a half, reached Ramleh,
the first halting-place on the road, and remarkable
for its broad and clean streets, and its well-to-do,
sleepy appearance. Indeed, but for the
hideously diseased and distorted mendicants, one
might have thought one’s self in some rather odd-looking
English or French or German village;
which feeling would not be dispelled by the
homely appearance of the primitive little German
hotel, where we were supplied with cold meat
and salad, and the most delicious beer we had
tasted since leaving England—<i>Marzenburg Export
Bier</i>, it was called. After a short halt, we
remounted, having only paid a hurried visit to
the tower of Ramleh—a landmark for some
distance over this flat country, and whence one
obtains an extensive view. The road now improves
somewhat, though there is little of interest
or beauty to be seen. An hour’s ride brought us
to the village of Kubâb, where we obtained some
oranges and a drink of water, the heat being very
great.</p>

<p>Leaving Kubâb, we shortly after entered the
valley of Ajalon, where we enjoyed a pleasant
gallop over the rich soft earth skirting the fields,
which in a few weeks would be covered with
verdure. The roadway itself was in course of
being mended, and one pitied the unhappy
occupants of the vehicles forced to traverse the
highway. Here we were passed by hundreds of
pilgrims, with whom we exchanged the usual
‘Liltak said,’ or ‘Naharak rubârah,’ of friendly
greeting; and shortly after ascending an incline
at the end of the valley, reached Latroon, the
supposed birthplace of the Penitent Thief. By
the roadside was a rough kind of restaurant, at
which many pilgrims were regaling themselves
with coffee, cakes, fruit, and their hubble-bubbles.
But turning off the main road, we alighted at
the <i>Latroon Hotel</i>, where everything was of a
rather primitive character, but managed by a
civil and intelligent young Greek. We were
made very comfortable. The freshness in the
air here was delightful, after our dusty and hot
ride; and as it was now about four o’clock, and
there was still a good six hours to Jerusalem, we
determined upon staying at Latroon for the night.
The interesting historical associations of the
surrounding country—the passing of the pilgrims—the
tinkling of bells—the finely placed ruin
of the ‘Castle of the Good Thief’—the rustic
character of the people about, who forgot even
to ask for backsheesh—the fertile fields—here
a group of Bedouins with their camels brought
to knee—there a batch of pilgrims settling down
for the night—while shepherds hurry home their
flocks, and horses and mules and asses are being
tethered for the night—all served to bring before
one a charming and interesting picture, that was
well worth the delay.</p>

<p>After a very refreshing night’s rest in a clean
and comfortable room, we started betimes next
morning. Half an hour from Latroon brought
us to the mouth of Wady Ali, a lovely glen,
through which one enters amongst the Judæan
hills. The glen, with large rocks and boulders
on either side, but rich in wild-flowers of all
kinds, and prominent amongst them our own
national thistle, did indeed at times remind us
of spots we had known in the west of Scotland.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">{323}</span>
After winding through a delightfully picturesque
valley, well wooded, and rich in olive groves,
we began to make the ascent of the Judæan hills,
winding round and about by steep zigzag paths,
occasionally obtaining fine views of the surrounding
country, and on reaching the summit, had
a splendid panorama of the coast of Syria with
the Mediterranean beyond, and away to the south
the bare Desert of Tih, running up to the well-cultivated
country of Palestine. We had last
seen this Tih Desert from the mountains of
Sinai, away to the south-east.</p>

<p>The country about the summit of the Judæan
hills is wild and bare and rocky; and as we
begin again to descend gradually by zigzag and
abrupt ups and downs, the road is often steep,
and always difficult, and gives one an opportunity
of testing and admiring the sureness of foot of
the Arab horse. Poor as were the specimens we
bestrode—and neither of the riders was a light
weight—they picked their way amongst loose
stones or glistening rocks, and down the steep
inclines, with a perfectly marvellous facility, and
galloped over the rough rock-strewn roads as if
their legs were made of cast-iron. It is rare to
find an Arab that will trot properly. The usual
pace is a quick walk, or an amble, a most serviceable
pace, which they seem capable of keeping up
indefinitely, and which is as little distressing to
the horse as to his rider. The shoe, which
consists of a flat piece of metal with a hole in
the middle, certainly does not seem to the stranger
exactly adapted to their work; and a horse is
sometimes lamed by a small stone getting into
the hole; but acute judges say that this mode of
shoeing—common all over the East—has advantages
where the roads are hard, hot, and dry.</p>

<p>Presently we come upon the village of Kirjath-Jearim
(the ‘Village of the Grapes’), and passing
the possible Emmaus, descend to Kolonieh, close
by a river-bed, which we cross by a bridge,
to make the last ascent of the journey. On reaching
the top of this ascent, Jerusalem appears
suddenly close to us with a suburb of modern
buildings: hospitals, almshouses, and villas—spick-and-span
with iron railings, porters’ lodges, and
clocks—European time, and Roman numerals on
the face! which make us rub our eyes for the
moment. Passing these, however, we come immediately
to the walls of the Holy City; and
turning sharply off to the left, past the new
German hotel (Fiel), the only one outside the
walls, we enter the Damascus Gate, and our
journey is at an end.</p>

<p>It does not come within the scope of the present
article to give a description, which has been done
a thousand times before, of anything beyond the
mere journey from Jaffa to Jerusalem. But in
a few words it must be said that the impression
is one of disappointment at Jerusalem. The
streets are dirty and ill-paved, and scarcely any
properly authenticated spot can actually be pointed
out. Each sanctimonious-looking dragoman has a
sniffle, and ‘lies like a wily Hindu.’ From the
Greek or Armenian priest who humbugs the miserable
pilgrims with his ‘Holy Fire,’ to the hawker
of cards of sham flowers from Zion or Bethlehem,
sham shells from the Jordan, or sham wood from
Olivet, there is nothing but falsehood and extortion.
About the only redeeming feature amidst
the mass of corruption, dirt, and hypocrisy, is the
well-kept and trim little English church, with
its decent congregation; while certainly the only
well-ordered quarter of the city is the Moslem
quarter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.—SUSPICION.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> those interlacing shadows of the bare
branches across the footpath through the forest
which had been like delicate fairy fretwork when
Philip passed along, broadened and deepened into
black masses before the father as he followed. He
had no purpose in following, beyond a vague
craving to know what Madge would say when
she learned that he had disinherited this favourite
of the family, and a fancy that it would be
pleasant to walk back with him, when he might
explain more fully than he had done the motives
by which he had been actuated.</p>

<p>He, too, knew this pathway well; but, although
he walked on, he had not yet decided to go all
the way. When he entered the glade in which
the King’s Oak reigned, he halted. This was a
place for elfin revels, and fairy-rings were common
in it. Every child brought here to play felt sure
that this was the very spot where little Red
Riding Hood met the wolf, and that her grandmother’s
cottage stood over there, where some
funny people tried to make them believe was
once a Roman camp. Romans indeed! as if they
were going to give up the delightful association
of Red Riding Hood with the place for a lot of
dull people they were forced to read about in
school-books! And, of course, it was here also
that the other Hood called Robin assembled with
his merry men, and Little John and Friar Tuck.
It was no use attempting to correct their geography
by informing them that Sherwood Forest
was a long way from here: the child’s imagination
insists upon associating its heroes with known
places.</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh was reminded of the happy group
of children he had found here in the sunshine
not long ago, and as their bright faces rose before
him in the soft twilight, he seemed to grow strong
again. Pleasant memories are as helpful to us
as pleasant anticipations.</p>

<p>When he resumed his way, he walked more
firmly than he had done since Philip left him.
He had now decided to go on and wait for him
near the stile; and he unconsciously quickened
his pace, although aware that he would have
plenty of time to spare. On reaching the roadway,
however, he proceeded leisurely, listening to
the river, but hearing no melody in it.</p>

<p>As he approached the stile, he saw the figures
of a man and woman slowly cross the road. They
shook hands, and he heard the man say:</p>

<p>‘I have your promise, and I shall hold you to
it. Be faithful, and I shall be able to think of
the past without pain.’</p>

<p>There was a reply, but in a tone so low that
it did not reach his ears. He recognised in the
man the stranger who had recently taken up his
quarters in the village, although he had only
seen him once and, then, at a distance. The
woman was Madge.</p>

<p>They parted. She hurried up the meadow; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">{324}</span>
after a brief pause, Mr Beecham turned in the
direction of the village.</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh had involuntarily halted, feeling
that he was the accidental spectator of an incident
for which the actors had not desired an audience.
Beecham’s words and the girl’s manner satisfied
him of that. He became immediately aware,
however, that standing still would naturally suggest
that he was playing the part of a spy. And
he could not escape observation, for the man was
coming straight towards him. He, therefore,
resumed his leisurely pace.</p>

<p>As was frequently his habit, Mr Beecham
walked with head slightly bent, his eyes seeming
to read strange writings on the ground. At the
sound of approaching footsteps, he looked up.
There was a momentary and unaccountable change
in his expression—as if he had suddenly passed
under the shadow of a tree, and coming into
the full light again it was placid and gentle as
usual.</p>

<p>‘Good-evening,’ said Mr Hadleigh hastily,
remembering the country custom he had adopted
of saluting any one he encountered on the
road.</p>

<p>‘Good-evening,’ echoed Beecham, with a slight
inclination of the head.</p>

<p>They passed, moving quietly on their opposite
ways. Neither looked back, for each was conscious
that the other intended or wished to do
so, and did not care to be caught in the act.</p>

<p>That is one of the droll sensations often
experienced in the common course of daily life.
We meet a friend, part, and without any reason,
have a desire to look after him, but restrain ourselves,
lest he, being similarly disposed, should
‘catch us at it.’ We laugh at ourselves, and
forget the absurd impulse. But what informs
the look, the breath, the tone which makes us
like or dislike a man or a woman without any
apparent justification? The mystery is one which
the poets and philosophers of all ages seem to be
continually touching, but never grasping. Some
call it instinct, others animal magnetism. All
we know is that we feel and cannot tell why;
but there are few who have not had occasion to
regret that they have not allowed themselves to
be guided by this inexplicable influence.</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh, merely passing this stranger in
the deepening twilight, knew that he was a foe.</p>

<p>Whether or not surprise at the words he had
overheard, and wonder at their being addressed
to Miss Heathcote, had anything to do with the
sensation, he could not tell; but he felt as keen
a chill as if he had passed an iceberg—mentally
and physically the sensation was exactly the
same. Yet he had heard nothing but praise of
this quiet, kindly-looking gentleman. There was
a degree of chagrin, certainly, in the thought that
in a few weeks Mr Beecham—a casual visitor, as
he might still be called—had obtained more influence
amongst the villagers than the master of
Ringsford had won by years of endeavour to help
and guide them.</p>

<p>Of course, Mr Hadleigh attributed this success
to the fact that the stranger was indiscriminate
in his charity. He gave help wherever it was
wanted, without taking the trouble to inquire
into each case, or to advise the recipients of his
bounty as to the future conduct which would
insure their independence. He gave them their
own way, in short, saying nothing about the
carelessness which created their necessities. To
a man who has the means, this is the easiest and
shortest road to popularity. But this could never
result in permanent benefit to the poor.</p>

<p>Now, Mr Hadleigh had really tried to do
permanent good: and, compared to this newcomer,
he was still a stranger amongst the people.
All allowance being made for the difference of
temperament and the difference of method, it
was difficult to understand why Mr Beecham
should so quickly win what Mr Hadleigh had
long striven for with so little result—the affection
of those around him.</p>

<p>He turned his eyes inward: was not this part—a
great part—of the penalty he had to pay for
making worldly success his first thought and
Love the second? Was it too late to win one
heart? He had gained the admiration, the esteem,
the envy of many: was it too late to win one
heart? How common folk would laugh at this
rich, prosperous man, if they knew that life
was a misery to him because he had cast away
its crown—if they knew how gladly he would
change places with his poorest labourer, if by so
doing he might secure the affection for which
he craved.</p>

<p>If Philip’s mother had been with him, he would
have lavished upon her all that wealth could
buy!... There he stopped, in bitterness, for
he came to the end of his world again: wealth
could not buy love. Obsequious submission, a
show of respect, obedience to his orders, he
could hire: but that was all. This man
Beecham, without apparent effort or sacrifice,
obtained at once the ‘Something’ that was
beyond price.</p>

<p>To his relief came curiosity and suspicion of—he
did not know what. But why should this
man receive any promise from Miss Heathcote?
Why should it have to do with his past? Why
should she, who was to be Philip’s wife, be there,
speaking to a stranger, when her lover was waiting
for her?</p>

<p>He halted, and after a moment’s hesitation,
turned in the direction of the village. He was
not to wait for his son.</p>

<p>At first he walked slowly, as if he might still
change his mind; but as his thoughts quickened,
so did his steps, and the church tower was
looming darkly against the slate-like sky when
he stopped at the gate of Mr Wrentham’s
cottage.</p>

<p>A pretty little squat building of one story,
lying well back from the road; a patch of green
surrounded by bushy evergreens, and the front
wall covered with trellis-work, at present supporting
a spider’s web of branches, which in season
blossomed into red and white roses, making
the cottage look like a bower rather than a
homestead.</p>

<p>At the gate, Mr Hadleigh again hesitated, as
if doubtful whether or not to carry out the
intention which had brought him to the place.
Since the evening of Philip’s accident, he had
spoken very little in private to Wrentham.
Natural enough as the accident had appeared,
he was afflicted by an uneasy feeling that
Wrentham had something to do with bringing
it about, and that to his own visit to Golden
Alley the first blame was due.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">{325}</span></p>

<p>With some impatience at his weakness, he rang
the bell and advanced to the door. The servant
was new to the place, and required to ask the
visitor’s name; whereupon a door was flung
open, and Wrentham came out with effusive
cordiality.</p>

<p>‘My dear Mr Hadleigh, this is a grand surprise.
I won’t stop to ask you what has made you
think of dropping in upon me; but I must say
thank you for a new pleasure. Come in, come
in; there is nobody here but myself. I have only
arrived within the last five minutes, and Mrs
Wrentham is putting our girl to sleep. You have
passed over these stages of domestic inconvenience;
but you can excuse us for not being always in
reception order. We let our visitors take us as
they find us, and those who don’t like it need not
come again. Simple and sensible rule, is it not?
But we should have liked <i>you</i> to find us a little
more in apple-pie order, especially as it is your
first visit.’</p>

<p>This was spoken with Wrentham’s usual gay
rapidity, allowing his unexpected guest no opportunity
to protest, as he ushered him into a tidy
little drawing-room which was apparently very
much in ‘reception order.’ Chairs, tables, nick-nacks
were almost too primly arranged to accord
with the free-and-easy ways which the owner
professed. He was, however, so seldom in the
room that he was ignorant of its condition. The
dining-room, on the other side of the passage, was
his ‘snuggery,’ and there he spent his evenings
when at home, which was seldom until late at
night; and frequently he was absent for days
on business.</p>

<p>But he was an affectionate husband and father.
He was particular about having his wife and
daughter always dressed in the newest and finest
fabrics, and regularly took them out for a treat
on Saturday or Sunday. Mrs Wrentham was a
delicate, nervous lady, apparently content with
her lot, and glad to escape from the toil of visiting
and receiving visitors. Her whole existence was
filled by her child Ada, a bright creature of
eight years, nicknamed by her father ‘Pussie,’ on
account of her passionate attachment to cats.</p>

<p>‘Will you take a chair?’ Wrentham went on.
‘You are such a fellow for taking one by surprise—always
a pleasant surprise; but you give
one no chance of doing anything to show how
it is appreciated. You dropped down upon me
in Golden Alley, just as you have dropped down
upon me here, without the least warning.’</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh listened patiently, his cold, dreaming
eyes staring vacantly at him, but closely
noting every change on his face.</p>

<p>‘I hope I do not disturb you?’ he said quietly,
taking the proffered chair.</p>

<p>‘My dear sir!—as if I should not be delighted
to see you under any circumstances—at any time—in
any place!’</p>

<p>‘You are very kind. I come to you for the
same reason that I visited your office—I want
some information which I think you may be able
to give me.’</p>

<p>‘About your son? I am afraid there is not
much I can say in regard to him that will be
satisfactory to a man of business like yourself.’</p>

<p>Wrentham shook his head and shrugged his
shoulders, as if the subject were one he would
rather not discuss.</p>

<p>‘It is not about my son that I desire to speak
to you this time.’</p>

<p>There was a peculiar emphasis on the last two
words, suggestive that the result of the former
conversation had not been satisfactory. Wrentham
was, or very cleverly affected to be, unconscious
of the suggestion.</p>

<p>‘I am glad of that—real glad, as Americans say.
And yet I have more than once had a notion of
going to you and asking you to try to bring the
young man to reason. I am supposed to be his
manager and adviser. My management consists
in doing the work of a message-boy—that is,
strictly carrying out his instructions: my advice
is nowhere.’</p>

<p>‘I have no desire to interfere with him in his
present course.’</p>

<p>‘So I supposed, and that is what has kept me
from going to you. I had no idea, until after
accepting this agreement with him, that he was
such an obstinate beggar—you know that I am
speaking of him as my friend. He has got this
mania—I have told him that I consider it a
mania—and he sticks to it. Unfortunately, his
uncle approves of it; but you know that this is
not business—he will never get anything out of
it.’</p>

<p>‘Not in your sense, Mr Wrentham; but there
are some profits which cannot be reckoned by
the figures in our ledgers—and some losses
too.’</p>

<p>‘Undoubtedly, sir, undoubtedly; at the same
time, you cannot blame me for taking the commonplace
view of things, and regretting that a young
man with such a splendid opportunity should
deliberately chuck it into the gutter. Why, with
his capital, I can see a magnificent future, if he
would only consent to follow the dictates of
common-sense.’</p>

<p>‘You mean those dictates which lead to the
making of money. His notion is to make people
happy. Well, as you are aware, I have had some
experience in obeying common-sense, as you understand
it; and I am curious to see the result of
Philip’s experiment. I have no desire and no
right to interfere with him.’</p>

<p>‘The result will be ruin—absolute ruin. In
less than twelve months he will not have a penny
of the whole capital now at his disposal. However,
as you say, we have nothing to do with it.
At the same time, I trust you will, for my sake,
remember by-and-by that I have entered my
protest against the course he is pursuing.’</p>

<p>‘I shall remember,’ said Mr Hadleigh, inclining
his head gravely. ‘What I called to ask you
was, do you know anything about Mr Beecham,
who seems to have taken permanent quarters at
the <i>King’s Head</i>?’</p>

<p>‘Beecham!’ exclaimed Wrentham gleefully, as
if intensely relieved by an agreeable change of
subject. ‘I should think so. I believe that it
was my privilege to be the first amongst his
acquaintances in Kingshope. I don’t think he
would object to my saying that he is a friend of
mine. A capital fellow—simple as a child, and
yet wise as a philosopher ever can be.’</p>

<p>‘That sounds like a sneer at philosophers.’</p>

<p>‘I did not mean it; but there is a difference
between the man who is a philosopher and the
man who is up to the time of day. Now, this
Beecham has travelled a great deal, read a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">{326}</span>
deal, and knows a great deal; but he doesn’t
know a game at cards. I had to show him how
to play Nap!’</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh was not interested by this record
of the simplicity of the stranger; he was occupied
by some other reflection, which caused his brows
to contract and his eyelids to droop.</p>

<p>‘Has he told you what part of the world he
comes from?’</p>

<p>Wrentham laughed.</p>

<p>‘Why, he comes from everywhere—America,
Australia, and likely enough the North Pole,
although he has not particularly referred to it.’</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh rose.</p>

<p>‘Will you find out for me, if you can, where
he came from last?’</p>

<p>Wrentham became suddenly serious.</p>

<p>‘You don’t suppose there is anything wrong
about him? He acts and talks straightforwardly
enough.’</p>

<p>‘I am asking you, Mr Wrentham, for information,’
answered Mr Hadleigh with a mechanical
smile. ‘If you have won money from him in
betting or playing Nap, I have no doubt you
will be paid. My inquiry is suggested by the
fact, that he has reminded me of an old—acquaintance’
(he seemed to falter over the word, as if he
had wished to say friend, but could not). ‘Should
he be the man, I want to have a little conversation
with him.’</p>

<p>‘Meaning no harm to him?’ queried Wrentham,
suspiciously.</p>

<p>‘On the contrary—good to him and to myself.’</p>

<p>‘Then I shall go along and see him this
evening. He’ll tell me at once.’</p>

<p>‘I would prefer that my name was not mentioned.’</p>

<p>‘Oh ... that may make a difference. However,
I have no doubt of being able to give you
the information you want by to-morrow.’</p>

<p>Mr Hadleigh went away, turning his steps
homeward. Through the forest again. Those
withered branches were like the milestones of
his life, and the pathway of withered leaves was
a fitting one for him. You who love nature
know that those leaves which the careless call
dead are the nurses of the coming spring blossoms;
and to him they brought back old thoughts, old
faces. How beautiful they are: beautiful, because
our tenderest thoughts have their roots in
graves.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SOME_CURIOSITIES_OF_THE_PEERAGE">SOME CURIOSITIES OF THE PEERAGE.</h2>
</div>

<h3 title="PART II.">IN TWO PARTS.—PART II.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most recent instance of reviving an extinct
title is the assumption by Sir Henry Brand, late
Speaker of the House of Commons, of the
Viscounty of Hampden. It is usual for the
Speaker, on retiring from office, to be created a
Viscount, and there are circumstances of interest
surrounding the elevation of Sir Henry Brand
to this dignity. In the first place, he is heir-presumptive
to the barony of Dacre, now held
by his brother, the twenty-second lord, who was
born in 1808. Should, therefore, Lord Hampden
survive Lord Dacre, the ancient barony will
merge in the recent viscounty and be lost sight
of. But why should Sir Henry Brand have
chosen the title of Hampden? The fact is this
title is young compared with the <i>name</i> borne
by ‘the great Buckinghamshire Esquire,’ as
Macaulay calls the illustrious patriot. It was
created in 1776, when Robert Trevor, fourth
baron of that title, assumed the name of Hampden,
and was created Viscount Hampden of Great and
Little Hampden, in the county of Bucks, where
the Hampdens had been the untitled lords long
before the Conquest. Three Trevor-Hampdens
bore this title, which became extinct in 1824.
Now, between the Trevors and the Lords Dacre
there is a connection, which we will endeavour
to shortly exhibit. The original family name
of the Lords Dacre was Dacre; but an unusual
variety of other surnames have been at different
times assumed by them. In 1715, the fifteenth
lord died without male issue; and his daughter
Anne became Baroness Dacre, sixteenth holder of
the title, who was three times married, and had
male issue by each of her husbands. One of
them, Thomas Barrett Lennard, became seventeenth
Lord Dacre. A son, Charles, by her second
marriage, became the husband of Gertrude,
daughter and co-heir of John Trevor, Esq., of
Glynde in Sussex. The children of Charles and
Gertrude were a son and a daughter; of whom
the former became eighteenth Lord Dacre, and
the latter another Baroness Dacre (nineteenth),
who married, in 1771, Thomas Brand, Esq., of the
Hoo, Welwyn, Herts; and thus we bring together
the Trevors and the Brands. The twentieth Lord
Dacre died without issue, and was succeeded by
his brother, the twenty-first lord, who assumed
the name and arms of Trevor, in compliance with
a direction in the will of the last Viscount
Hampden. Accordingly, while the surname of
the present Lord Dacre is Trevor, that of his
brother, Lord Hampden, is merely Brand. It is
understood that some members of the family of
the Earl of Buckinghamshire, whose patronymic
is Hobart Hampden—they being descended in the
female line from the patriot, who left no male
issue—endeavoured to dissuade Sir Henry Brand
from taking the title which he chose. But surely,
considering the circumstances mentioned above,
he was justified in his selection; and all will
feel that the title of Hampden could not be borne
by one more worthy to be associated with this
great name than the late Speaker.</p>

<p>The foregoing transcripts from titular and
family history have been somewhat detailed,
inasmuch as their features are representative of
many other peerages, and also elucidate various
matters connected with the peerage not patent
to all persons. They show <i>inter alia</i> how titles
may not only be extinguished, but may be shifted
about from family to family when the limitations
of those titles are in fee. They show, also, why
it is that a peer who is generally known by one
title may yet sit and vote in the House of Lords
or Peers by some other; the short explanation
being, that he is not a peer of the United
Kingdom, or, in other words, a peer of the entire
realm, so far as his first title is concerned. In
our previous paper ‘What is a Peer?’ this feature
of the peerage was alluded to; and we may now
add that there is only one peer, who, not being
a peer of the realm in regard to his chief title,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">{327}</span>
yet sits and votes in the House of Lords by a
title as exalted as the other. This is the Duke
of Hamilton, who, though premier Duke of
Scotland, yet, as such has no hereditary seat in
parliament,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> while as Duke of Brandon he has;
and he would be so described in the Lords’
division lists. Then, again, the Marquis of
Huntly, though premier Marquis of Scotland, is
yet only Lord Meldrum when sitting in the
House of Lords. The Marquis of Sligo is only
such in the peerage of Ireland, but sits in
parliament as Lord Monteagle; and there is also
a Lord Monteagle who is a peer of the realm by
that title only. The eighteenth Earl of Erroll is
singularly situated. When sitting in parliament
he is Lord Kilmarnock, and this is the courtesy
title borne by his eldest son, so that there are
two Lords Kilmarnock!</p>

<p>The distinctions just referred to between peers
of the United Kingdom and those who are not have
given rise to some singular features in the peerage
which are, at first sight, of an anomalous character.
Thus, while the son of a tradesman who becomes
a peer of the United Kingdom to-day may die
to-morrow, and his son may take his seat in the
House of Lords as an hereditary legislator; on
the other hand, the thirty-fourth Scotch Earl of
Mar—merely as such—and the thirty-first Irish
Lord Kingsale have no hereditary right to a seat
in the legislature, although the latter is premier
Baron of Ireland. It is of course competent to
the Crown—the fountain of honour—to promote
these and other noblemen similarly situated to
the peerage of the United Kingdom; but until
this is done, they take rank below the last created
baron of the realm. At one time it appears to
have been usual to honour a man by first making
him an Irish peer, and then to promote him
gradually, as in the case of Rawdon, Earl of
Moira, and conspicuously so in that of the
Fitzwilliam peerage and others. But then we
must remember that it was not before January
1, 1801, that the expression ‘United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland’ was known; nor
before 1707 that the term ‘Great Britain’ was, or
could in law have been applied to England and
Scotland as a whole.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The one was created by
the statute 39 and 40 Geo. III. c. 67 (July 2,
1800), the other by 5 and 6 Anne c. 8 (May 1, 1707).
To these statutes we refer the reader desirous
of more information on this subject. He may
also peruse that interesting work of light reading,
<i>The Reports of the Lords’ Committees on the Dignity
of a Peer of the Realm</i>, comprised in four folio
volumes (1826).</p>

<p>In ‘What is a Peer?’ we made allusion to
peerages created by writ of summons and by
letters-patent. We may here observe that there
was another form of barony, that by tenure, which,
however, long ago became obsolete. Now, it is
to be remarked with regard to the creation of
a barony by writ of summons, that it always
conferred a peerage in fee—in other words, one
descendible to males and females—and this will
introduce us to two terms previously mentioned,
‘abeyance’ and ‘co-heirs,’ which require a short
explanation. It will be convenient to furnish
this by reference to those baronies of the
Huntingdon earldom which, we have seen, were
transplanted, so to speak, from the Hastings into
the Rawdon family by the single act of marriage
of an heiress of the former with a member of
the latter house. The word ‘abeyance’ itself
is peculiar, and signifies, to look at something
expectingly—in fact, with open mouth. It has
been used with regard to corporeal hereditaments;
but the subject of estates in abeyance, or in
<i>nubibus</i>, is far too intricate to be entered upon
here. We must, however, make some allusion
to the law of real property, in order to render
our succeeding statements intelligible—and titles
of honour are to be dealt with under the rules
of that branch of law. There are some of those
rules, however, which, though applicable to ordinary
incorporeal hereditaments, are not so to
titles of honour. Thus, while an acre of land
in fee is alienable, a title in fee is not; it may
devolve, but cannot be devised. Again, if the
tenant or, as we commonly say, the owner of
an estate in fee simple dies intestate, leaving no
sons, but daughters, all the latter inherit as
‘co-heirs,’ or, as lawyers call them, ‘coparceners,’
who are regarded in law as making one heir.
Under such circumstances, they may sever the
joint ownership if they like; but if they do not,
the entire estate may devolve upon the last
survivor, assuming the others to die unmarried
and intestate. This right of survivorship will
not, however, exist as against the heir of any
of them where the above circumstances are
wanting. Thus, if A. and B. are coparceners, and
B. marries, dies, and leaves a son C., the right of
B. will descend on C.; and so on. Well, now, a
title of honour clearly cannot be made the subject
of partition; and accordingly, if the male holder
of a barony which originated in a writ of summons
dies leaving two daughters, his barony does not
become extinct, but falls into ‘abeyance.’ If one
of these daughters marries, then dies, leaving a
daughter, but her own sister still unmarried, the
barony is still in abeyance until either the aunt
or her niece dies. If the latter predeceases the
former, leaving no issue, there is an end of the
abeyance; the aunt assumes the title; but if she
dies without having been married, the title then
becomes ‘extinct.’ If, on the other hand, the
niece has male children, and dies, her eldest son
succeeds; and if the latter dies without issue,
leaving no brothers or their issue, but only
sisters, who do not marry, the title will again
fall into abeyance. Thus, it is seen how a
barony may be in abeyance, and how there may
be co-heirs thereto as claimants also, how such
co-heirs and their heirs may exist as such for
an indefinite period, or until the title can devolve
upon <i>one</i> person. The Crown, however, may
exercise its prerogative of terminating the abeyance
in favour of one of them, as was done in
the Zouche peerage in 1828.</p>

<p>But to return to the Hastings’ honours, and the
baronies which Elizabeth transferred to the
Rawdon family. The first Baron Hungerford was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">{328}</span>
summoned by writ in the reign of Henry VI.;
and his son married Margaret, daughter of Baron
Botreaux, thus acquiring this title. Their son
Robert married the daughter of Baron Molynes
or Molines, and in her right assumed that title,
with his own and Botreaux. He was beheaded in
1463. The son of this last Baron Hungerford
had a daughter, Mary, who married the first Baron
Hastings somewhere about 1480, was summoned
to parliament by writ; and in 1485 the attainder
of the Hungerfords was reversed, and the family
honours were restored. The third Baron Hastings
was raised to the earldom of Huntingdon, in which
dignity these honours were merged; and when
the eighteenth earl died in 1789, they descended
to his sister, the mother of the first marquis, and
this is really how they came into the Rawdon
family. It will also be understood from what
precedes that the only dignity in the peerage
which can fall into abeyance, and, accordingly, to
which there can only be co-heirs, is a barony
created by writ; and we may observe, that when
it cannot be determined upon whom a higher
title devolves, there is said to be a ‘suspension’
of that title. It is also to be remembered that
as no barony is known to have been created by
letters-patent prior to the eleventh year of Richard
II., baronies created before then are presumed to
have been created by writ of summons.</p>

<p>We have said that the Crown by the exercise
of its prerogative may terminate an abeyance, and
this may be done either in favour of a person
who is, or one who is not, a peer. In the former
case, a writ of summons issues to him by the
style of the barony in abeyance; in the latter,
letters-patent are employed, and this is the
practice where the person on whom the title falls
is a lady.</p>

<p>And now a few words as to the ‘forfeiture’ of
a title. This will follow in all cases upon a
conviction for high treason, but not necessarily
for felony. If, however, a peerage has originated
in a writ of summons, and therefore descendible
to heirs-general, it will be forfeited on an attainder
for felony. It is a curious fact, too, that although
the Crown can pardon a criminal, it cannot in
any case restore a dignity once forfeited for
attainder, so as to place the offender and his
family <i>in statu quo</i>. This can be done only by
an Act of Parliament. The Crown can revive
the forfeited title, but it then becomes a new one;
so that if a twentieth Earl of X. is attainted,
although the Crown may create his son Earl of X.,
yet the latter becomes not the twenty-first, but
only the first Earl of X.</p>

<p>There is one more matter of interest which
ought to be mentioned here. We have seen that
the barons of Hungerford acquired two titles in
right of their wives. Now, with regard to real
property, if a man is married to a woman possessed
of an estate in fee simple or in tail, and she dies
without having had a child born alive, he will, in
the absence of a settlement, or a will by her to
the contrary, lose all interest in such property. If,
however, she has had a child which may have
lived only long enough to utter one cry, or can
be proved in any way to have lived after its
birth, the husband will in such case, after his
wife’s death, become tenant of the estate for life,
and will be termed ‘tenant by the curtesy.’ Such,
however, is not the case with regard to titles of
honour; and although, as we have seen, there are
instances of this ‘curtesy’ in regard to dignities,
yet, according to Sir Harris Nicolas, there are
none to be met with after the reign of Henry
VIII., the latest examples being those of Hungerford,
already referred to, and Strange.</p>

<p>Although the House of Lords is undoubtedly
an aristocratic assembly, yet it is essentially a
cosmopolitan body, and paradoxical as the statement
will perhaps appear, it may even be said
to be in one sense democratic. It is also to be
observed that in this respect the House of Lords
differs from the peerage viewed in its entirety.
For whereas the latter, so regarded, is aristocratic
because of the remote ancestry, wealth, and power
of many of its members who have no seat in the
House of Lords, yet this assembly, as a section
of the peerage, will be found to contain men
who may fairly be said to be—employing a significant
common phrase—‘Of no family at all.’
Hence our application of the term ‘democratic’
to this assembly; and on consideration, it will be
found to be hardly either far-fetched or inappropriate,
because the history of England will disclose
instances in which the sympathy of the House
of Lords has been with the people, where rights
and liberties have been endangered, either by
injudicious action by the Commons, by the
attempt to unduly enlarge the prerogatives of
the Crown, or from other causes. The truth is,
we have peers who have sprung from all sorts
and conditions of men—from traders, retail as
well as wholesale; also from the professions. Of
these sources of supply the legal profession is
the most distinguished, about half the members
of the present House of Lords, including
some of the oldest, wealthiest, and grandest
of them, either being descended from, or owing
their position to, successful members of the Bar.
We are not aware of any solicitor, as such, having
been raised to the peerage; but the great Lord
Chancellor Hardwicke, ancestor of the present earl,
commenced life as an articled clerk; and Thomas
Parker the first Earl of Macclesfield practised as
a solicitor before becoming a barrister. Like his
illustrious predecessor Bacon, he was impeached
for corrupt practices in his office, and fined thirty
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>It is amusing to notice—though, of course, the
fact is not mentioned as an argument for any
previous statement—that in the peerage we have
a Browne, a Jones, and a Robinson, which are
the family names respectively of the Marquis of
Sligo, Viscount Ranelagh, and the Marquis of
Ripon, the present Governor-general of India.
Four of our greatest dukes—Cleveland, Grafton,
Richmond, and St Albans—are severally descended
from Charles II. and his mistresses, the last-named
having for his ancestress the fair and amiable, but
frail Eleanor Gwynne, or as she is commonly
called, Nell Gwynne. Another ‘irregular scion
of royalty’ is the present Earl of Munster, whose
grandparents were King William IV. and Mrs
Jordan the actress. With regard to the above-named
dukes, it is a remarkable circumstance
that although the sovereigns of England ceased
in 1801 to perpetrate the act of absurdity and
effrontery of styling themselves kings of France,
yet the above-mentioned noblemen still quarter
the arms of that country on their heraldic shields.
At the same time, over such arms, which are those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">{329}</span>
of Charles II., there is placed the sinister<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> baton—that
is, one extending from nearly the top of
the left of the shield to nearly the bottom of its
right—which is the emblem of illegitimacy. Lord
Munster also bears the royal arms with the same
‘abatement,’ as a herald would say. Then, on
the other hand, there are eight dukes, three
marquises, seventeen earls, three viscounts, and
fourteen barons who are entitled to quarter the
royal arms of Plantagenet on their shields without
this said baton. But this is not so singular as
the fact disclosed during the course of the ‘Sussex
Peerage Case,’ to be noticed again presently, that
upwards of thirty thousand persons in this country
have royal blood in their veins!</p>

<p>The distinction between what may be termed
personal titles and those of a local or territorial
character should be observed. Occasionally, one
hears of a Marquis <i>of</i> Townshend, a Marquis <i>of</i>
Conyngham, an Earl <i>of</i> Waldegrave, <i>of</i> Granville,
&amp;c. Such expressions are erroneous; there are,
in fact, no such titles, and the ‘of’ is improperly
introduced. We ought to say Earl Granville,
&amp;c. So also with the Earls Cairns, Fitzwilliam,
Grey, Stanhope, &amp;c., whose name and chief title
are the same. We have, however, Earl Brownlow,
whose family name is Cust. Moreover, a
peer whose chief title is personal, may yet possess
others which are local, but not, so far as we
know, territorial. Thus, Earl Fortescue’s second
title is Viscount Ebrington, and the Marquis
Conyngham is Earl of Mountcharles. Again, all
a peer’s titles may be the same as his name, as
in the case of Sir J. V. S. Townshend, Bart., who
is Marquis, Viscount, and Baron Townshend. It
is, however, usual in this family for the eldest
son to be designated Viscount Raynham during
his father’s lifetime, the viscounty being, in fact,
‘Townshend of Raynham, in the county of
Norfolk.’</p>

<p>But even where peers do bear territorial or
local titles, as, for example, the Duke of Norfolk,
Marquis of Northampton or Earl of Derby, it
is not usual in society to so speak of them
except in the case of a dukedom; all noblemen,
whether actually so, or only by courtesy, being
styled simply Lord So-and-so.</p>

<p>It now and then happens that some distinguished
man, who for some reason is not disposed
to accept a peerage himself, will yet permit such
honour to be conferred on his wife. This was
the case with the late Lord Beaconsfield, whose
wife became in 1868 Viscountess Beaconsfield, her
husband still remaining a commoner. Then,
again, in 1836 the wife of Sir John Campbell,
afterwards Lord Campbell, and Chief Justice of
England, was raised to the peerage as Baroness
Stratheden, before her husband was, a circumstance
which will be found to disclose the unusual
fact of three baronies being conferred in the short
space of six years on two families, each indebted
for its elevation to nobility to a successful lawyer.
The father of Lady Stratheden was Sir James
Scarlett, who was created Chief Baron of the
Exchequer and Lord Abinger in January 1835.
Next year the Stratheden peerage was created;
and in 1841, Lady Stratheden’s husband became
Lord Chancellor of Great Britain and Lord
Campbell. She died in 1860, whereupon her
eldest son succeeded to her title. Lord Campbell
died next year; and the same nobleman also took
his father’s title. Thus we have what seems at
first sight the puzzling title of Stratheden and
Campbell.</p>

<p>There are a few other instances in the peerage
of the employment of a double title, for example,
the Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos; Hamilton
and Brandon; Richmond and Gordon: the Earls
of Mar and Kellie; Warwick and Brooke;
Pembroke and Montgomery; Stamford and
Warrington; Suffolk and Berkshire; Wemyss and
March; Winchelsea and Nottingham, &amp;c.: Viscount
Massereene and Ferrard (who sits as Lord
Oriel): Baron Saye and Sele; Baron Mowbray,
Segrave, and Stourton; Oranmore and Browne;
De L’Isle and Dudley, &amp;c., which the reader
inclined to do so may investigate for himself.</p>

<p>Then we have titles of another compound order,
as those of Lord Clifford of Chudleigh, Howard
of Glossop, Vaux of Harrowden, Willoughby de
Broke, Willoughby de Eresby, &amp;c.; and as an
instance of <i>idem sonans</i> in titles, we may mention
the barony of Middleton and the viscounty of
Midleton, the respective holders of which are
peers of the realm, and pronounce their titles in
the same way.</p>

<p>Some of the heraldic mottoes of our nobility
are extremely peculiar. A very blunt one is that
of Byron, <i>Crede Byron</i> (Believe a Byron). A few
of them have reference to the achievements for
which the peerage was originally conferred, or
from which promotion therein was the result.
Thus, Baron Exmouth, upon whom a viscounty
was conferred after the bombardment of Algiers
in 1816, placed his family motto over his crest,
and the word ‘Algiers’ under his shield. In the
same way the celebrated Field-marshal Viscount
Gough had the words ‘China,’ ‘Barrosa,’ and
‘Goojerat’ painted on his armorial bearings, also
the Irish words <i>Faugh a Ballagh</i>—that is, clear
the way, which is the war-cry of the regiment
known as the Connaught Rangers. Again, Lord
Radstock’s motto is ‘St Vincent,’ commemorating
a naval exploit of the first peer, who was a son
of the third Earl Waldegrave, which, however,
took place off Cape Lagos in 1797. The motto
of the hero John Jervis, who destroyed the
Spanish fleet off Cape St Vincent in 1797, and
who was raised to the peerage as Earl St Vincent,
was the strange-looking word ‘Thus,’ and it is
still borne by the representative of the Jervis
family, who, however, is only Viscount St Vincent.
‘Thus’ is a nautical term of command which,
shortly explained, signifies an order to keep the
ship’s head in the direction in which she is
proceeding. The motto of Earl Fortescue, <i>Forte
scutum salus ducum</i> (that is, A strong shield is
the safeguard of the leaders), is noteworthy.
According to Sir B. Burke, the ancestor of
the Fortescues was one Sir Richard le Fort, who
protected the Conqueror at the battle of Hastings
by his shield. <i>Escue</i> being the Norman word for
shield, it was added to <i>Fort</i>, and thus produced
the name and the title of Fortescue. The above
motto is also that of the Fortescues Lords Clermont,
who are kinsmen of the others. Two
ennobled barristers chose mottoes associated with
their professional pursuits, Pratt, Marquis Camden,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">{330}</span>
having taken <i>Judicium parium, aut lex terræ</i> (that
is, The judgment of our peers, or the law of the
land); while the renowned advocate Thomas,
Lord Erskine, adopted the phrase <i>Trial by Jury</i>.
This nobleman was the son of the fifth Earl of
Buchan, whose family motto is <i>Judge nought</i>;
and there is some singularity about the abandonment
of this motto for that of <i>Trial by Jury</i>.
There are two mottoes of an extremely suggestive
character—that of Earl Howe (<i>Let Curzon hold
what Curzon held</i>), and that of the Marquis
Conyngham (<i>Over Fork over!</i>). The history of the
latter family will show that the spirit of this
phrase, taken in its vulgar acceptation, has not been
disregarded by them. In some of the mottoes we
discover a play of words—a fanciful conceit, as
it would have once been termed. Thus, the
Earls of Onslow use the well-known proverb,
<i>Festine lente</i>, or ‘Hasten slowly,’ which evidently
has reference to the present form of their name,
On-slow, which, however, was originally Ondeslow.
Then, again, Earl Manvers’ is <i>Pie repone te</i> (Repose
with pious confidence). If the position of the
letters in the Latin words be changed, we have
<i>Piereponete</i>; and ‘Pierrepont’ is the family name
of the above nobleman. The motto of the Earls
of Wemyss, <i>This our Charter is</i>, contains their name
of Charteris. So also does that of the Roches,
Lords Fermoy, <i>Mon Dieu est ma roche</i>; and the
motto of the Earls of Sandwich, <i>Post tot naufragia
portum</i> (After so many shipwrecks, we arrive
at port). Then, again, the Duke of Devonshire,
and Lords Chesham and Waterpark, all of the
Cavendish family, have for their motto <i>Cavendo
tutus</i> (Safe by being cautious), evidently a <i>jeu de
mots</i>, a hazy sort of play on the name of the
title.</p>

<p>In a previous paragraph, we alluded to the
Sussex Peerage Case. This was a very painful
curiosity indeed of the peerage. The Duke of
Sussex, sixth son of George III., had married,
in 1793, Lady Augusta Murray, daughter of the
Earl of Dunmore. The marriage ceremony was
twice performed—first at Rome, and next at St
George’s, Hanover Square, and the union was
one of affection on both sides. Two children
were born of it—a son and a daughter, the
former having been Colonel Sir Augustus F.
D’Este, and the latter, Mademoiselle D’Este,
who became the second wife of Serjeant Wilde,
afterwards Lord Chancellor Truro. That lady
died in 1855 without issue, and the present
Lord Truro is accordingly descended from the
first wife. On the death of the Duke of Sussex
in 1843, Sir A. D’Este claimed the Dukedom of
Sussex; but the Prerogative Court of Canterbury,
the then forum of matrimonial causes, held the
marriage of his parents to have been null and
void, as contrary to the provisions of the Royal
Marriage Act (12 Geo. III. c. 11). Sir Augustus
D’Este died in 1849; and this lamentable story in
its legal aspect may be read in the second volume
of Clark and Finnelly’s <i>House of Lords’ Reports</i>.
The Sussex Peerage Case, beyond its painful
interest, is of importance to lawyers, several
rules of the law of evidence having been fixed
by it. The same may be said of some other
peerage cases, as those of Banbury and Shrewsbury.
And we may also mention that one which probably
stands without a parallel in the records of
scandalous family history, the celebrated Berkeley
Peerage Case, a veritable curiosity, not of the
peerage only, but of human life generally, being,
in fact, an agglomeration of frauds, perjuries,
and immoral proceedings, all surrounded by an
atmosphere of the most repulsive vulgarity. We
gladly pass it by. Indeed, it ought, except
for illustrative purposes, to be let severely
alone.</p>

<p>We have spoken in a previous paragraph of
‘premier peerages;’ and perhaps a few words are
necessary on this subject.</p>

<p>The premier peerages of the realm are as
follows:</p>

<p><i>England</i>—Duke of Norfolk, 1483; Marquis
of Winchester, 1551; Earl Shrewsbury, 1442;
Viscount Hereford, 1550; Baron Le Despencer,
1264.</p>

<p><i>Scotland</i>—Duke of Hamilton, 1643; Marquis
of Huntly, 1559; Earl Crawford, 1398; Viscount
Falkland, 1620; Baron Forbes, 1442 (?).</p>

<p><i>Ireland</i>—Duke of Leinster, 1766, who is also
premier Marquis and Earl of Ireland; Viscount
Gormanston, 1478; Baron Kingsale, 1181.</p>

<p>Of all these, Kingsale is the oldest existing
title, but, as already intimated, Lord Kingsale
has no seat in the House of Lords. The barony
(by writ) of Le Despencer is the oldest in
England, but is at present held by a lady, who
is the wife of Viscount Falmouth, whose son is
therefore heir to both titles. The oldest title
borne by a member of the House of Lords under
which he sits and votes is that of De Ros, this
barony having been created 1264, but after that
of Le Despencer.</p>

<p>Earls, Viscounts, Barons, and Baronesses are
entitled to be styled ‘Right Honourable;’ a Marquis
is ‘Most Honourable,’ or ‘Most Noble and
Puissant Prince;’ a Duke is ‘Most Noble,’ or
‘Most High, Potent, and Noble Prince.’ All peers
except barons are by the etiquette of heraldry
regarded and styled as cousins of the sovereign.
Thus, a Viscount or an Earl is addressed as,
‘Our right trusty and well-beloved Cousin;’ a
Marquis as, ‘Our right trusty and entirely beloved
Cousin;’ and a Duke as, ‘Our right trusty and
right entirely beloved Cousin.’</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> a rule, the course of true love runs smoother
in Kaffir-land than in more civilised countries.
The reason for this is not far to seek. In Europe,
the business of matrimony is complicated by its
being associated with the impulses of the
heart; but amongst our Ethiopian brethren the
emotional has but little place or power. The
whole affair is simply arranged by the father of
the girl. Eight or ten oxen are handed over to the
dusky Paterfamilias by the eligible suitor, who in
exchange receives the damsel—blushing, no doubt,
if one could perceive it beneath the dark skin.
In rare instances, it may be a case of mutual
affection; and in the true story which I am about
to relate, affairs went ‘clean off the track’ in
a quite phenomenal fashion. A good deal of this
romantic drama, which took place in and about
Maritzburg, the capital of Natal, came under
the immediate notice of my wife and myself,
while the rest of it was told us by one or other
of the chief actors.</p>

<p>It was towards the close of a summer afternoon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">{331}</span>
The day had been more than usually hot, but
a slight curtain of cloud was now pleasantly
veiling the sun. Our house was situated on a
gently rising ground on the outskirts of the
town—a comfortable one-storied cottage, surrounded
by a deep veranda, and standing a short
distance back from the road. There would have
been sultry stillness, but for the chirp and whir
of insects, the too frequent ‘ping’ of the mosquito
as it hovered around one’s ear, the ‘clunk-clunk’
of the frogs in a neighbouring streamlet, and the
sonorous voice of our Kaffir ‘boy’ chanting
some barbarous lay in one of the outhouses.
Occasionally a creaking, full-laden bullock-wagon
would toil past, drawn by a span of twelve or
fourteen patient oxen, and overhung by a cloud
of red dust, stirred up from the broad, rut-lined,
arid highway. Anon, a buggy would dash jolting
along, to the imminent danger of family groups
of itinerant Kaffirs, who would, with a loud
‘Wow!’ jump aside; and once in a while a solitary
horseman, booted and spurred, would be seen
galloping to or from the town.</p>

<p>I was lying in a swing-hammock suspended
in the veranda, smoking a cigar, and fitfully
reading that day’s paper. Now and again, my
eye mechanically rested on the road, watching
the several wayfarers. Presently my attention
was more particularly drawn to a young Zulu
woman, who had opened our front gate, and was
slowly walking up the path leading to our house.
She was probably about seventeen years of age,
though, to one unacquainted with Kaffir physique,
she might have seemed at least twenty-one, and
moved with the erect and graceful carriage characteristic
of the race. Her dress consisted of
what may be best described as a canvas tunic,
which had originally been a sack, but round the
arm-holes and short skirt was a border of many-coloured
beads. Upon her shapely arms were
brass rings and circlets of beads, while similar
ornaments graced her calf and ankle. Her hair
had been combed up, stiffened with red clay, and
tied into a bunch—a toilet significant of her status
as a married woman, the Kaffir virgin usually
rejoicing merely in her primitive ‘wool.’</p>

<p>The young woman’s steps were directed to the
back of our premises, where she disappeared.
What could she be after? The next moment I
said to myself that she must be one of our
‘boy’s’ relations. The kinship of one’s Kaffir
boy, be it here remarked, is invariably very
extensive; and unless you exercise some strictness,
your rearmost premises are very apt to be
invaded by his parents, his brothers, ‘his sisters
and his cousins and his aunts,’ not to speak of
his uncles and vaguely remote relatives. Our
boy, Capelle by name, had been told that we
were not to be annoyed by frequent visits from
his friends; and as that day he had already
welcomed and hospitably fed—with <i>our</i> maize-meal—about
half-a-dozen of his acquaintances,
I somewhat resented the coming of this youthful
matron.</p>

<p>It was in my mind to jump out of the hammock
and remonstrate with our domestic, when I heard
stealthy footsteps in the veranda. The next
moment Capelle stood before me, asking permission,
as far as I could make out, for his sister to
remain overnight. My wife now appeared, telling
me that Capelle and the young woman had
been having high words in the Kaffir-house.
Thereupon I questioned him as to the cause of
the quarrel. ‘Baas’ (Master), he began; and
then delivered a fluent discourse in his native
tongue, doubtless full of information, but almost
wholly unintelligible to me, until my wife acted
as interpreter. My better-half, having to scold
and direct the boy, had in about two years’ time
mastered the colloquial Kaffir generally spoken in
Maritzburg kitchens. Out of the facts extracted
from Capelle and his sister by cross-examination,
the following interesting narrative was evolved.</p>

<p>Some six months previous, this young woman,
whose name was ’Manthla, had plighted her troth
to one Umhlassu, who was now working as a
porter at an ironmonger’s in Maritzburg, and was
rapidly saving up the money to buy the necessary
cattle wherewith to purchase her from her papa.
He had now eight oxen, only two short of
the number required, and had secured a hut
for her reception. For her part, ’Manthla had
given Umhlassu a pair of earrings, a necklace,
a snuff-box, bead ornaments for the head, and
other gifts such as Kaffir maidens present to
their lovers. Unfortunately, another wooer had
come to her father, offering twelve bullocks for
’Manthla; and the parent, very naturally—for
such doings are not unknown even in Mayfair—favoured
the wealthier suitor. The oxen were
accepted there and then, without the daughter
being consulted in the matter. As a rule, the
reception of the live-stock by the father is an
important point in the marriage-service of the
Zulus. The next step is the arranging of the
wedding-feast, at which there generally is dancing
for two or three days, as well as the consumption
of one of the oxen which form part of the
‘marriage-settlement,’ not to mention the drinking
galore of native beer.</p>

<p>’Manthla had steadily declined to take any
part in the proceedings, though she had been in
the charge of the matrons of the kraal, who had
dressed her hair in the manner already described.
With still greater persistence, she refused to
accompany Indebbelish, her would-be lord and
master, to his kraal, even going the length of
producing a knife and protesting she would take
away her life, rather than become his bride. Her
father threatened to beat her with a stick; all
her friends upbraided her; and finally, she was
handed over to the old women, who kept her
a prisoner and all but starved her, to induce
a better state of mind. Her almost unheard-of
defiance of ‘use and wont’ astonished the
marriage-party; but their amazement reached
its climax when, in the midst of the festivities,
it was discovered that ’Manthla had seized a
favourable opportunity to escape. She had
travelled on foot fifty miles into Maritzburg,
and it was at the close of that journey that I
had seen her from our veranda.</p>

<p>When ’Manthla had greeted her brother and
told him the whole story, he was of course highly
indignant at her disregard of tribal custom. He
rated her in good sound terms, jeered at her,
and treated her to a variety of ill-favoured epithets,
in which the Zulu vocabulary is unusually
rich. It was the sound of this fraternal reproof
which my wife had heard. There was really
nothing for it but to give shelter to the fugitive
for at least one night. It would scarcely have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">{332}</span>
been humane to have turned ’Manthla adrift,
tired and hungry as she was; and accordingly the
‘pilgrim of love’ was allowed to take her fill of
porridge and sleep on the kitchen floor.</p>

<p>Early next morning, as I was mounting my
cob at the stable-door, preparatory to a ‘spin’
over the <i>veldt</i> before breakfast, there appeared an
elderly Kaffir, who held up the forefinger of his
right hand and exclaimed ‘Inkosi!’—the native
salutation of respect. This was no less a personage
than Pank, the father of ’Manthla and of our
boy Capelle. He was attired in a soldier’s old
coat, and ragged trousers that descended no
farther than his knees. On his head was a
battered felt hat; while through the lobe of one
ear was stuck a cigar, and through the other a
cylindrical ‘snuff-box.’ Though old Pank had
come in hot haste from the kraal all those fifty
miles, and was presumably in a state of great
mental agitation, he sauntered into our back-yard
as carelessly as if he had only casually dropped
in from next door. I have noticed the same
characteristic in several other Kaffirs. After the
afore-mentioned salutation, Pank’s lean face
broadened into a grin, and he vivaciously ejaculated
two or three times: ‘It’s allee right, allee
right!’ This phrase, which proved to be the
only English at his command, was introduced
with great frequency, and sometimes with ludicrous
effect. This optimist remark, however, was
not upon his lips when he caught sight of his
daughter ’Manthla timidly peeping out from the
door of the Kaffir-house. His face darkened in
expression, and pouring forth a volley of reproaches,
the ‘stern parient’ approached her. I
stood anxiously watching the interview, fearing
lest violence might be the outcome. But after
Pank had uncorked the vial of his wrath, it
quickly evaporated, and in a short time he sat
down on his haunches, took the snuff-box from
his ear and regaled himself with a hearty pinch.</p>

<p>I rode off; and on my return, half an hour
later, the old fellow was in our kitchen, calmly
consuming a large pot of porridge. It turned out
that he had ordered ’Manthla to be ready to
accompany him at once to the kraal of Indebbelish.
Alas, however, for the ‘best-laid schemes!’
When the <i>babba</i> (father) went into the Kaffir-house,
he found ’Manthla had again fled. His
anger and disgust were now turned upon Capelle,
who vowed he had had no hand in her flight.
The father retorted, the son recriminated, and it
was only by rushing out and brandishing my
riding-whip that order was restored. The old
man suddenly grinned and exclaimed: ‘Allee
right, allee right!’ and then his eye catching sight
of a big iron pot which had fallen into disuse,
he asked if we could spare it. My wife sarcastically
inquired if there was anything else he
would like; upon which Pank requested a bottle
of castor-oil, for the purpose of anointing his
body when he reached home. This being given
him, the injured father strode away, with the
big pot over his head like a huge helmet, and
we hoped we had seen the last of him. Not at
all! In five minutes or so the old rascal came
back, begging Capelle’s wages for the next three
months. It is customary for the <i>babbas</i> to collect
the money due to their sons, but payment
in advance was altogether without precedent.
Happily, by disbursing the wages due for a
month which had almost expired, we for a time
got rid of the father of our heroine.</p>

<p>It is time that we again followed her fortunes.
When ’Manthla ran away from our house, she
betook herself to Umhlassu, who, true lover that
he was, forsook his work, packed up his blankets,
and went off with his bride to his own kraal.
Feasting and dancing were again indulged in,
this time, however, by the bridegroom’s relatives.
Hearing of this, the unsuccessful Indebbelish
indignantly demanded the cattle back from
’Manthla’s father; but this just request was point-blank
refused. Indebbelish saw he had no other
alternative but to trudge into town to institute an
action for ‘breach of promise’ against Babba Pank.
The machinery of the native court in Maritzburg
was in due course set in motion, and the case
appointed to come off in three weeks, a fact we
knew one evening by the advent of Indebbelish,
who was about the most handsome Kaffir we had
ever seen. He came to have a chat with Capelle,
who had favoured his wooing in time past, and
was still friendly. We naturally objected to have
our larder drawn upon alternately by the plaintiff
and defendant in the pending suit, and so declined
to give Indebbelish board and lodging. But he
made up for this by calling night after night and
smoking Capelle’s tobacco.</p>

<p>At length the great day of the trial dawned,
and with it came the beaming face of ’Manthla’s
father with his irrepressible ‘Allee right!’ He
marched in and billeted himself upon us for about
six days. I am not aware whether this was
owing to prolonged litigation or to the enjoyment
of living at some one else’s expense. At all events,
when the week expired, the <i>babba</i> vouchsafed the
information that the case had gone against him,
and that he had to restore the bullocks, at the
same time cheerily adding: ‘It’s allee right, allee
right!’ Nevertheless, he went away very downcast,
after another ineffectual attempt to collect
Capelle’s wages in advance. A day or two afterwards,
the cattle were returned to Indebbelish
with a bad grace; but Umhlassu gave Babba
Pank eight oxen, with a promise of other two
at some future period; and the heart of the old
man rejoiced. The sympathies of my wife had
been aroused in favour of Indebbelish; but her
interest instantly vanished when she found that
‘the poor, forsaken young man,’ long previous to
his ‘courtship’ of ’Manthla, was already possessed
of three wives! When Indebbelish received back
the oxen from the <i>babba</i>, he simply drove them off
to another kraal, and purchased an ebony virgin
to complete his connubial quartet.</p>

<p>About eighteen months afterwards, I happened
to be amongst the Saturday morning throng on
the Market Square of Maritzburg. Hundreds of
people—English, Dutch, Indian, and Kaffir—were
moving about the dusty expanse of ground, which
was covered with auctioneers’ stands, bullock-wagons,
sacks of produce, cows and horses on sale,
and large quantities of the miscellaneous household
goods which find their way to colonial marts. At
one part of the ground, a number of Kaffir wives
were squatted alongside heaps of firewood, which
they had conveyed into town, and were now selling.
As I observed them, my boy Capelle suddenly
drew my attention to a woman who was walking
towards the group. She carried a great load
of firewood in long lengths poised upon her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">{333}</span>
head, and a baby slung behind her in a blanket.
I dimly recollected her face; Capelle told me her
name, and ran forward to speak to her. It was
none other than the heroine of the love-match—poor
’Manthla!</p>

</div>


<h3 title="PART II.">IN TWO PARTS.—PART II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> in the former part of this paper considered
certain theories concerning the nature,
qualities, power, and vitality of love, we would
now invite the attention of our readers to some
of the symptoms, evidences, and effects of that
passion. Here we find ourselves upon somewhat
firmer ground, for the field now before us is
not so much that of theory and definition as
of observation and experience. While the profoundest
philosophers find themselves at a loss
in attempting to formulate some satisfactory
theory on the subject, the most unsophisticated
observer can tell us something of the signs and
tokens by which love manifests its presence. The
symptoms of the tender passion are both varied
and varying, and we have it on the authority
of Addison that there is no other passion which
produces such contrary effects in so great a
degree. Byron describes love as bearing within
itself ‘the very germ of change.’</p>

<p>For a thoroughly comprehensive catalogue of
love’s tokens take the reply of Silvius to Phebe
in <i>As You Like It</i>. ‘Good shepherd,’ says Phebe,
‘tell this youth what ’tis to love.’ ‘It is,’ replies
Silvius, ‘to be all made of sighs and tears; it is
to be all made of faith and service; it is to be
all made of fantasy, all made of passion, and all
made of wishes; all adoration, duty, and observance;
all humbleness, all patience, and impatience;
all purity, all trial, all observance.’ If
the foregoing be accepted as an accurate description
of what it is to love, one is enabled to understand
the belief that the reason why Love is
not included among the virtues is that it combines
them all in one.</p>

<p>Dryden has given us several accounts of the
way in which the tender passion operates upon
the mind. In one passage he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Love various minds does variously inspire:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He stirs in gentle natures gentle fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like that of incense on the altar laid;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But raging flames tempestuous souls invade:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A fire which every windy passion blows;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With pride it mounts, and with revenge it glows.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The same writer, descending to more everyday
observations, and speaking of the condition
of a person in love, declares:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">You pine, you languish, love to be alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Think much, speak little, and in speaking sigh.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is certainly a faithful description of the
conventional lover, whom you meet in novels,
and there are no doubt a great many sentimental
people who still languish and sigh, after the old
romantic pattern. Yet there are a great many
more who get through all their love experiences
with very little languishing and very few sighs.
They are much too busy, or too cheerful, or too
matter-of-fact, to indulge their passion to the
pining or languishing degree; so that tears and
sighs and groans are not by any means inevitable
or necessary symptoms of love. While one lover
is to be found ‘sighing like furnace, with a
woeful ballad made to his mistress’ eyebrow,’
another is discovered basking joyfully in the
sunshine of his love, and singing with Moore
that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s nothing half so sweet in life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As love’s young dream.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ovid remarks that tears are by no means
unserviceable in love, because by tears you may
touch a heart of stone. He therefore advises the
lover to endeavour that his mistress should find
him with his cheeks bathed in tears; and he
adds, that if you are not quite equal to the
shedding of genuine tears, you may bathe your
eyes and cheeks by other means. But Ovid is
discoursing on the <i>art</i> of love, and what we are
at present considering are the true marks of
the genuine passion. There are, no doubt, few
matters in which there has been, since the world
began, so much dissimulation and hypocrisy as
in love affairs, and Ovid’s artful suggestions recall
the profane observation of a cynical writer, that
‘Love consists of a little sighing, a little crying, a
little dying—and a deal of lying.’ It is not our
present purpose, however, to enter upon the false
in love, or the spurious impersonations which
stalk about in his name. Let it suffice to say
that Ovid’s crafty advice is founded on the fact
that true love is often tearful and desponding.
It may not be, as Silvius puts it, ‘all sighs and
tears,’ but even the most sanguine love may have
its moments of sadness and doubt. ‘Love,’ says
one of the poets—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">Love, though most sure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet always to itself seems insecure.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And Scott declares that ‘Love is loveliest
when embalmed in tears.’ Another poet argues
that unless you quake and are struck dumb
when your mistress enters the room, you have
loved amiss, and must begin anew.</p>

<p>But if love is sometimes downcast and fearful,
it just as often soars aloft on the pinions of hope,
for ‘Love can hope where Reason would despair.’
The lover has a miraculous way of finding hope
and encouragement amid the most unpromising
circumstances. He can feed for weeks together
on a word or a glance; and if his mistress frown
and turn her back upon him, he must still lay the
flattering unction to his soul that she merely
frowns, as Shakspeare expresses it somewhere, to
beget more love in him. Truly, the lover had
need be ‘all patience,’ for ’tis a fickle god he
woos. If he would not woo in vain, he must
bear with a thousand caprices, inconstancies, and
tyrannies.</p>

<p>Lovers are proverbially blind to each other’s
shortcomings, and their praises of each other
are therefore untrammelled by ordinary scruples
on the score of veracity. ‘There never,’ says
Bacon, ‘was a proud man thought so absurdly
well of himself as the lover doth of the person
loved.’ It is therefore at once easy and natural
for men and women under the influence of the
tender passion to present to each other, and to
swallow with the keenest relish, a great deal of
this kind of food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">{334}</span></p>

<p>If we are to credit the French poet Chamfort,
who says he has seen women of all countries, an
Italian woman does not believe that she is loved
by her lover unless he is capable of committing a
crime for her, an Englishwoman an extravagance,
and a Frenchwoman a folly. Let us hope that
worthier performances than these are sometimes
demanded in token of love’s sincerity—acts of
self-denial, of merit, of generosity, and of faithfulness.
Richter is of opinion, however, that
‘love requires not so much proofs as expressions
of love—it demands little else than the power to
feel and to requite love.’ Dryden gives expression
to the same idea, when he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">All other debts may compensation find,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Love is strict, and must be paid in kind.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How often has love spurned riches, power,
enjoyment, the good opinion of the world, and
everything else, in order to meet responsive love
amid poverty, suffering, deprivation, and even
dishonour! True love will sacrifice everything
to be requited; for ‘Lovers all but love disdain.’</p>

<p>Whatever form its manifestations may take, it
may be assumed that the fickle god will not fail
to show itself. ‘There are two things not to be
hidden,’ says the proverb—‘Love and a cough.’ It
may be expressed by sighs and tears, by a dejected
and distracted mien, and by what Shakspeare calls
‘the pale complexion of true love.’ It may be
discovered in tell-tale blushes—‘celestial rosy
red, Love’s proper hue,’ as Milton puts it—in
bashful awkwardness, and in a distressing self-consciousness
in the presence of the adored object.
And it may be shown no less plainly and emphatically
in quiet self-devotion, dutifulness, and self-sacrifice.
It often identifies itself with various
kinds of manias, such as a mania for composing
amatory epistles or writing verses, a mania for
going to church, for haunting a particular street,
or for buying kid gloves, patent-leather boots,
and eau-de-Cologne. These, with many other
similar and equally harmless symptoms, are quite
familiar.</p>

<p>Then there is a more extravagant class of manifestations
that the hard unfeeling world would
describe as folly. When love reaches what Bacon
calls ‘the mad degree,’ there is absolutely no limit
to the excesses that may be perpetrated in its name.
But of the comparatively harmless kinds of folly
there is usually a considerable admixture in even
the sedatest loves. Thomson describes the lover
as ‘the very fool of nature.’ It is not, of course,
to be supposed that he is ever conscious of his
folly—when he is engaged in it, at all events—for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Love is blind, and lovers cannot see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The pretty follies that themselves commit.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet it cannot be denied that the folly in love
is, to the lovers, by no means the least agreeable
part of it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I could not love, I’m sure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One who in love were wise,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>is Cowley’s frank confession; and most lovers,
if they carefully examine their experience and
speak the truth, will echo the sentiment. Wisdom
would never give utterance to all those fond,
foolish fancies, those ‘airy nothings,’ and sweet
flatteries that the lover prizes so much; and
wisdom would often dictate a degree of prudence
and reserve and formality that could never be
endured by two hearts that beat as one.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The proverb holds, that to be wise and love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is hardly granted to the gods above.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After what we have seen of Cupid’s fickleness
and ever-varying moods, it will not be imagined
that when love is not all smiles and sunshine, it
is therefore insincere or undesirable. In the
words of the poet Walsh:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Love is a medley of endearments, jars,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Suspicions, quarrels, reconcilements, wars,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then peace again.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After the storm, the sun returns as bright and
genial as before, and the air is all the purer and
the sweeter for the electric war that has disturbed
its stillness. The love that cannot outlive a few
misunderstandings and disagreements can hardly
claim to be considered as genuine, and had better
be allowed to pass at once into the limbo of
exploded myths. The truth is, however, that
Love often dispenses his favours in a very eccentric
way, and each favour is sometimes paid for
with a more than proportionate amount of suffering;
so that the lover must be often tempted to
exclaim with Addison:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mysterious love! uncertain treasure!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hast thou more of pain or pleasure?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet he will probably resolve the problem in much
the same manner as the poet does in completing
the stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Endless torments dwell about thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet who would live and live without thee?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Spenser finds that ‘love with gall and honey doth
abound,’ and in computing the proportion of each,
he expresses the belief that for every drachm of
honey there is a pound of gall. Notwithstanding
this, however, he is prepared to assert that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">One loving hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For many years of sorrow can dispense;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A drachm of sweet is worth a pound of sour.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is the attitude which the lover must adopt;
and if the gall preponderate in his experience—which
we sincerely hope it won’t—he must comfort
and sustain himself with thoughts of the
honey he has enjoyed, and that may be yet in
store for him.</p>

<p>If the course of true love does not run smooth,
that is not always because the way is not clear
enough or level enough, but very often entirely
on account of Love’s injudicious and impracticable
behaviour. If Love will indulge his propensity
to masquerade in the guise of frenzy or delirium,
folly or extravagance, there is nothing at all surprising
in his getting into trouble. But what is
the use of sermonising? Notwithstanding all the
striking lessons he has received, and the painful
experiences through which he has passed, Cupid
is still much the same wilful, rollicking, mischief-loving
sprite that he was when he first appeared
upon our planet; and so, no doubt, he will remain
to the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>At the same time, when all is said and done,
is it not just possible that Love gets blamed for
a good deal of trouble and mischief for which
he is really not responsible? Do people not often
cry out against Love’s tyranny and unreasonableness,
when they ought to blame their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">{335}</span>
selfishness, or pride, or blundering stupidity?
Love must be treated as an honoured guest, not
as a slave; and if he leave us, may we not reasonably
ask ourselves, before we begin to upbraid
and revile him, whether we have not driven him
away by our own neglect and heartlessness and
querulous impatience? When we consider how
he is sometimes treated, the wonder is, not so
much that he should have departed, as that he
should have stayed so long.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PROGRESS_OF_CYCLING">THE PROGRESS OF CYCLING.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is exceedingly interesting to the reflective
cyclist of the present day to indulge in a retrospect
of ten or fifteen years, and compare his present
position with the status that subsisted in those
early days of the wheel. Nothing could better
illustrate the rapid growth of this comparatively
modern method of locomotion than the spread
and increasing importance of the various Exhibitions
in different parts of the country devoted
entirely or in part to demonstrating the advances
made in the two or three wheeler during the recess
of winter. And these advances have been most
marked during the past year, the machines now
exhibited showing plainly the care and attention
bestowed upon them. In one important detail
in particular this is markedly apparent, namely,
in that of gearing for tricycles. It is a well-known
fact among cyclists that the temporary exhaustion
following the rapid traversing of a smooth level
road does not proceed in a tenth degree so much
from the actual strength expended as upon the
rapid exertion required. To obviate this, a system
of gearing-up has been introduced, whereby the
wheels make more revolutions than the feet. But
as this would place the rider at a disadvantage in
ascending inclines or in traversing rough roads, a
system of gearing level or down has been combined,
whereby, by a mechanical arrangement, the wheels
perform either the same number of revolutions as
the feet, or less. The combination of these systems
has produced some of the most intricately ingenious
mechanisms that have lately appeared before the
public, and cyclists are busily engaged in testing
and otherwise determining which system shall be
introduced into their mounts for the coming
season.</p>

<p>In the June number of the <i>Journal</i> for last year
we predicted the approach of a period of unusual
activity in cycling, and the prediction has not
proved fallacious; for the season which closed
with the approach of last winter was remarkable
in many respects, as the following will show. In
October, the extraordinary distance of two hundred
and sixty miles was ridden on a two-wheeler
in twenty-four hours over ordinary roads; a
tricycle under similar circumstances has covered
over two hundred and twenty-one miles when
ridden by a gentleman, and one hundred and
fifty-two miles when propelled by a lady. In
August, a tricycle was driven from John o’ Groats
to Land’s End—ten hundred and seven miles—in
fourteen days; the bicycle record by a shorter
route being a little over nine days; whilst in
October a bicyclist rode from London to Derby—a
distance of one hundred and twenty-six miles—without
either stopping or dismounting. Many
feats of endurance and determination similar to
the above have taken place upon the public roads;
whilst upon the racing-path, the great feature
has been the ‘record cutting’ of the year. In
1882, a well-known doctor and amateur bicyclist
rode twenty miles and three hundred and twenty-five
yards in an hour; in 1883, this was beaten
by a professional at Leicester, who covered twenty
miles nine hundred and five yards in the same
time; whilst the time for one mile has been
lowered from two minutes forty-one and three-fifth
seconds to two minutes forty and four-fifth
seconds. The time for one mile for a tricycle was
also lowered to three minutes five seconds, and
all existing tricycling records from a quarter of a
mile to one hundred miles were beaten last year.
But the rapid advances which characterise the
sport will doubtless enable faster times than the
above to be made in the not far distant future,
and the records which we now behold with
pardonable pride may sink into comparative
insignificance.</p>

<p>The objection has been raised by many opponents
of cycling that it is of no practical value
to mankind apart from the means it provides for
healthy recreation. This objection no longer
exists. The tricycle is now used extensively in
many parts of the kingdom by professional men;
clergymen in particular are very partial to it; to
the doctor it is a positive boon, ay, and to the
patient as well at times, for in an emergency,
the ready steed can be mounted at once, and
no delay caused by awakening drowsy coachmen
and harnessing horses. A new description of
tricycle now enables enterprising tradesmen,
notably news-agents, grocers, and others whose
wares are of a comparatively light nature, to
deliver their goods with more despatch than
formerly; and the Post-office authorities have
been alive to the advantages offered by this means
of distribution by obtaining machines for rural
districts in connection with the Parcels Post and
the delivery of letters. The Inland Revenue
Office by a recent order recognises the tricycle;
and the police in some of our colonies have used
them for some time. These facts plainly show
that the tricycle has entered upon a new phase
of its existence, and that a noble and useful career
undoubtedly awaits it.</p>

<p>The ‘freemasonry of the wheel’ has been pushed
on to a greater extent than ever during the past
year, and is a factor which undoubtedly influences
a large proportion of the British public. This is
shown by the increasing numbers of the Cyclists’
Touring Club, which increased from seven to
nearly twelve thousand during 1883, and promises
to reach even twenty thousand during the current
year. The ladies are giving their heartiest support,
and are joining in large numbers; whilst
the movement offers so many attractions to all
riders in providing touring companions, hotels
with fixed tariffs in nearly every town in Great
Britain and the continent, good-fellowship and
congenial society wherever the cyclist may happen
to alight, and other advantages too numerous to
mention, that it includes in its roll many of the
nobility and gentry in all parts of the land, and
is supported by some of the highest dignitaries
of the Church and members of the legal, medical,
military, and naval professions.</p>

<p>Other great cycling institutions exist, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">{336}</span>
are rendering good service to the general public
in various ways, one notably in calling attention
to the decadence of our public roads since the old
coaching-days. In many parts of the country,
main roads now exist that are all but impassable
to ordinary traffic; their deterioration may be
attributed mainly to the competition and monopolisation
of the railways in diverting the traffic
that once passed over them. Their condition is
a misfortune to the public in general, and especially
to the inhabitants of the locality; for as
good roads are certain to advance the prosperity
of a district, so bad ones have ever been considered
an indication of a backward state of civilisation.
The local authorities to whom the construction
and maintenance of these roads have been
intrusted, are being aroused to a sense of their
responsibility by influentially and numerously
attended meetings of persons interested in cycling;
the laws relating to the highways have been
collected and discussed, and many leading newspapers
have given prominence to the grievances
vented at these assemblies. If the result should
be the amelioration of the condition of these
highways, the thanks of the general public will
be due to the cyclists, and it will tend to forge
still stronger the link which is fast binding them
into closer fellowship.</p>

<p>To many manufacturing towns, the rise of
cycling has been a boon; to one in particular,
Coventry, it has proved perhaps the greatest
blessing that has ever befallen it. That ancient
city was fast sinking into absolute inertness
through the falling-off of its staple trade; it
can now boast of being one of the most prosperous
towns of the midlands, with huge manufactories
and busy hives of men sending forth to the
world those apparently delicate structures which
are now in such universal request. Other towns,
such as Birmingham, London, Wolverhampton,
&amp;c., sensibly feel the demands of the two hundred
thousand cyclists who are computed to be in
Great Britain alone, and the export trade of
these towns is rapidly becoming greater in this
particular branch. The two and three wheeler
have now penetrated to nearly every part of the
globe; they are no longer strangers to the Russian,
the Turk, and the Hindu; in Brazil, Australia,
and New Zealand, they make steady progress;
and even the sacred land of the Celestials is not
free from their enchantments. This wide and
general dissemination of a sport which is essentially
English, cannot fail to be a source of the
greatest gratification to those who so sturdily
fought for it and upheld it during the trials of
its early existence.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Wooed the white clusters of the hawthorn trees.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She spoke of twittering birds, and raised her eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Bright with the glory of poetic thought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the dark ceiling that shut out the skies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And lowered upon her, as she vainly sought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With words of loving sympathy, to cheer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The flickering life that suffering made so dear.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For oh, that life, unlovely though it seemed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Was the dear object of her fondest love;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Volumes of witching poesy she dreamed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Morn, noon, and evening, as she bent above</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His weary form, yet neither light nor bloom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could tempt her footsteps from that dingy room.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oft, when she heard his hollow cough, she wept</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In the still midnight—how it wrung her heart!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yea, she could hear it even when she slept,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And often wakened with a feverish start,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beseeching God, in many a tearful prayer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To ease the pain that <i>she</i> so longed to share.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Blithely she carolled when the morning sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Rose o’er the alley like a blushing bride;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or grave and silent, like some meek-faced nun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Plied she her needle by the sufferer’s side—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And oh, it was so sweet to toil for him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till her hands trembled, and her eyes grew dim!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Till from those weary hands her work would fall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And her dim vision could distinguish nought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save the black spiders crawling on the wall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the dead violets she herself had bought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the few coppers she had stored away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From her poor scanty earnings day by day.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For when before the market-stall she stood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Her little purse clasped tightly in her hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She needs must purchase—for each dewy bud</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Seemed like a messenger from fairyland;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And well her fine poetic fancy knew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sheltered places where the violets grew.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And when she raised them to her eager lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With the pure rapture of a little child,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dewdrops twinkled on their azure tips,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Till the young dreamer bent her face and smiled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the sweet consciousness that they would bring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into the meanest slum a breath of Spring.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Returning home, her joyous footsteps fell</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Like the soft patter of the summer rain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And oh, <i>one</i> weary sufferer knew it well,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And moaned a welcome from his bed of pain!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Close to his breast she crept, and kneeling there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He twined the violets in her sunny hair.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Charmed from his fretful mood, the sufferer laid</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">One thin white hand upon her worn gray dress;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Dear child!’ he murmured, while the sunbeams played</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">At hide-and-seek amid each wandering tress,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Withdraw the blind—let in the rosy morn;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>I</i> too am grateful that the Spring is born!’</div>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
